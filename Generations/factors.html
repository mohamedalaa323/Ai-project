            <h1>advantage of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a term for simulated intelligence in machines. These machines are programmed to think like a human and mimic the way a person acts. it sometimes called machine intelligence.
                it’s a very important science nowadays that has positive and negative effects, we will explain them in this article as follow.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Positive Effects of Artificial Intelligence :
                    <p>AI helps to automate digital processes for businesses and therefore lower labor costs for businesses.

                       AI would have a low error rate compared to humans if coded properly. They would have incredible precision, accuracy, and speed.
                       They won’t be affected by hostile environments, thus able to complete dangerous tasks, explore in space, and endure problems that would injure or kill us.
                       Replace humans in repetitive, tedious tasks and in many laborious places of work.
